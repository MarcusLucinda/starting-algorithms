## Binary search

Binary search is an algorithm that receives a sorted list and returns the position of a specified element.
It works eliminating half of the available items every step, verifying if the reference is lower o higher. It has a runtime of O(log(n)).

```python
def binary_search(list, item):
    low = 0
    high = (len(list) - 1)

    while(low <= high):
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        guess = list[mid]
        if(guess == item):
            return mid
        if(guess > item):
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return None


my_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(binary_search(my_list, 3))
print(binary_search(my_list, 4))
```


```

None

## Recursion

Recursion is where a function calls itself. Recursive functions have two parts; the base case and the recursive case.
The recursive case is when a function calls itself, the base case is when doesn't go on an infinite loop.
Recursion is used when it makes a solution clearer, there is no performance enhancement for using recursion. In fact, sometimes loops perform better.

```python
def factorial(x):
    if(x == 1):
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * factorial(x-1))
```

```

## Selection sort

Selection sort is an algorithim that sorts a list of elements. 
It works by finding the smallest item on a list a popping it into the sorted list. It's a slow algorithm with the runtime of O(nÂ²).

```python
def findSmallest(arr):
    smallest = arr[0]
    smallest_index = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < smallest:
            smallest = arr[i]
            smallest_index = i
    return smallest_index


def selectionSort(arr):
    new_arr = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        smallest = findSmallest(arr)
        new_arr.append(arr.pop(smallest))
    return new_arr


print(selectionSort([5, 3, 6, 2, 10]))
```

```
[2, 3, 5, 6, 10]
```


## Quicksort

Quicksort is a faster algorithm for sorting a list of items. It select a pivot and separate the list, than it uses recursion to call the quicksort on the splited list unitl the base case is reached.
It has a runtime of O(nlog(n)).

```python
def quicksort_best(array):
    if len(array) < 2:
        return array
    else:
        n = randrange(len(array))
        pivot = array.pop(n)
        less = [i for i in array if i <= pivot]
        greater = [i for i in array if i > pivot]
        return quicksort_best(less) + [pivot] + quicksort_best(greater)
```

```
[1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13]
```


## Euclid's Algorithm
It's an algorithm tha receive two numbers and returns the greatest common divisor.

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while (y !=0):
        r = x % y
        x = y
        y = r
    return x

print(gcd(1680, 640))
```
```
80
```
